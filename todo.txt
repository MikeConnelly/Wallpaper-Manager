on startup, frontend needs to grab all current data from backend
user selects filter for wallpaper (temp, weather, day, etc.)
react sends choose img request to api with filter data
api opens file explorer
api stores img path with filter data in array
user hits apply changes button - react sends post
api copies files and application data to app_data

filter options:
    time of day:
        from
        to
    weather:

priority system:
    priority is always shown and updated by the items position in the list
        needs to be added in the create api
        make put api for when items in the list are reordered
    when getting all items from store, sort in order of priority
    replace id with priority? Or just use id instead of priority
        i would have to update ids on frontend???
        don't actually store priorities, just sort the list???

priority issues with only time high priority being better than both less priority
