use the file browser only on the backend, send the file img and name to frontend. React should not access file system.

on startup, frontend needs to grab all current data from backend
user selects filter for wallpaper (temp, weather, day, etc.)
react sends choose img request to api with filter data
api opens file explorer
api stores img path with filter data in array
user hits apply changes button - react sends post
api copies files and application data to app_data

look into background processes for actually updating the wallpaper
