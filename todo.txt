on startup, frontend needs to grab all current data from backend
user selects filter for wallpaper (temp, weather, day, etc.)
react sends choose img request to api with filter data
api opens file explorer
api stores img path with filter data in array
user hits apply changes button - react sends post
api copies files and application data to app_data

look into background processes for actually updating the wallpaper

filters: need to create, edit(need unique id), delete. If no picture, use defalut
need default before anything works
how to do filters:
    add button to open a new filter menu and file button
    add button should send a post request to create a new wallpapers entry
        with a unique id, default filter, empty wallpaper path

get rid of changes?
