on startup, frontend needs to grab all current data from backend
user selects filter for wallpaper (temp, weather, day, etc.)
react sends choose img request to api with filter data
api opens file explorer
api stores img path with filter data in array
user hits apply changes button - react sends post
api copies files and application data to app_data

have priority field to sort by
filter options:
    time of day:
        from
        to
    day of week
    weather:
        rainy
        sunny
        snowy
        stormy

will run into errors when copying same file twice into appdata - not deleting when changing

clearing time makes it null instead of empty string, probably a problem
